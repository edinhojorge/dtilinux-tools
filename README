Dependency on redhat 6

I recently installed it on redhat 6, and had to install the following RPMs:
- wxBase-2.8.12-1.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm
- wxGTK-2.8.12-1.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm
- wxGTK-media-2.8.12-1.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm
- wxGTK-gl-2.8.12-1.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm
- wxPython-2.8.12.0-1.el6.x86_64.rpm


Troubleshooting:

Error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./getlog.py", line 24, in <module>
    import pexpect
ImportError: No module named pexpect

Solution:
Install pexpect packages
eg: yum install pexpect

Error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./getlog.py", line 28, in <module>
    import wx
ImportError: No module named wx

Solution:
Install wxPython and dependencies. Check "Dependendy on redhat 6"
